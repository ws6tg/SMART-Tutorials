Welcome to SMART Tutorials
=========================

We provide five examples detailing SMART's workflow, 
including data preprocessing, spatial neighbour graph construction, 
MNN triplet samples calculation, model training, clustering, and visualization.

You can start with any of the following tutorials:

- :doc:`Tutorial 1: Simulated multi-omics data integration <tutorials/Tutorial_1/index>`  
  Demonstrates preprocessing, spatial graph construction, and integration workflow.

- :doc:`Tutorial 2: 10X human lymph node data integration <tutorials/Tutorial_2/index>`  
  Covers data loading, spatial analysis, and visualization.

- :doc:`Tutorial 3: MISAR-seq mouse brain data integration <tutorials/Tutorial_3/index>`  
  Includes spatial neighbor graph construction and clustering.

- :doc:`Tutorial 4: P22 mouse brain section data integration <tutorials/Tutorial_4/index>`  
  Shows multi-slice alignment and analysis.

- :doc:`Tutorial 5: 10X human tonsil multi-slice integration <tutorials/Tutorial_5/index>`
